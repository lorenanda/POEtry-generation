              "'\\nTHE RAVEN.\\n\\n\\n  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\\n  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--\\n  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\\n  As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.\\n  \"\\'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--\\n          Only this and nothing more.\"\\n\\n  Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,\\n  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\\n  Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\\n  From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--\\n  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\\n          Nameless here for evermore.\\n\\n  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\\n  Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\\n  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\\n  \"\\'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--\\n  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--\\n      This it is and nothing more.\"\\n\\n  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\\n  \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\\n  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\\n  And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,\\n  That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--\\n        Darkness there and nothing more.\\n\\n  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,\\n    fearing,\\n  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\\n  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\\n  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\\n  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\\n        Merely this and nothing more.\\n\\n  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\\n  Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.\\n  \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\\n  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--\\n  Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--\\n      \\'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"\\n\\n  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\\n  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\\n  Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;\\n  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\\n  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\\n      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\\n\\n  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\\n  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\\n  \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\\n    craven,\\n  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\\n  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night\\'s Plutonian shore!\"\\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\\n  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\\n  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\\n  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\\n  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\\n        With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\\n  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\\n  Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\\n  Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--\\n  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\\n        Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\\n  \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\\n  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\\n  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\\n  Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore\\n      Of \\'Never--nevermore.\\'\"\\n\\n  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\\n  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and\\n    door;\\n  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\\n  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\\n  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\\n      Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\\n  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom\\'s core;\\n  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\\n  On the cushion\\'s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o\\'er,\\n  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o\\'er,\\n        _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\\n\\n  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\\n  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\\n  \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\\n    sent thee\\n  Respite--respite aad nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!\\n  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!\"\\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\\n  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\\n  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\\n  On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\\n  Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\\n  By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\\n  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\\n  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\\n  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  \"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,\\n    upstarting--\\n  \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night\\'s Plutonian shore!\\n  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\\n  Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\\n  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\\n\\n  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\\n  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\\n  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon\\'s that is dreaming,\\n  And the lamp-light o\\'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\\n  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\\n      Shall be lifted--nevermore!\\n\\n\\nPublished, 1845.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nTHE BELLS,\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\n  Hear the sledges with the bells--\\n  Silver bells!\\n  What a world of merriment their melody foretells!\\n  How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,\\n  In their icy air of night!\\n  While the stars, that oversprinkle\\n  All the heavens, seem to twinkle\\n  With a crystalline delight;\\n  Keeping time, time, time,\\n  In a sort of Runic rhyme,\\n  To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells\\n  From the bells, bells, bells, bells,\\n  Bells, bells, bells--\\n  From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\n  Hear the mellow wedding bells,\\n  Golden bells!\\n  What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!\\n  Through the balmy air of night\\n  How they ring out their delight!\\n  From the molten golden-notes,\\n  And all in tune,\\n  What a liquid ditty floats\\n  To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats\\n  On the moon!\\n  Oh, from out the sounding cells,\\n  What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!\\n  How it swells!\\n  How it dwells\\n  On the future! how it tells\\n  Of the rapture that impels\\n  To the swinging and the ringing\\n  Of the bells, bells, bells,\\n  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,\\n  Bells, bells, bells--\\n  To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\n  Hear the loud alarum bells--\\n  Brazen bells!\\n  What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!\\n  In the startled ear of night\\n  How they scream out their affright!\\n  Too much horrified to speak,\\n  They can only shriek, shriek,\\n  Out of tune,\\n  In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,\\n  In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire\\n  Leaping higher, higher, higher,\\n  With a desperate desire,\\n  And a resolute endeavor\\n  Now--now to sit or never,\\n  By the side of the pale-faced moon.\\n  Oh, the bells, bells, bells!\\n  What a tale their terror tells\\n  Of Despair!\\n  How they clang, and clash, and roar!\\n  What a horror they outpour\\n  On the bosom of the palpitating air!\\n  Yet the ear it fully knows,\\n  By the twanging,\\n  And the clanging,\\n  How the danger ebbs and flows;\\n  Yet the ear distinctly tells,\\n  In the jangling,\\n  And the wrangling,\\n  How the danger sinks and swells,\\n  By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--\\n  Of the bells--\\n  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,\\n  Bells, bells, bells--\\n  In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!\\n\\n\\nIV.\\n\\n  Hear the tolling of the bells--\\n  Iron bells!\\n  What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!\\n  In the silence of the night,\\n  How we shiver with affright\\n  At the melancholy menace of their tone!\\n  For every sound that floats\\n  From the rust within their throats\\n     Is a groan.\\n  And the people--ah, the people--\\n  They that dwell up in the steeple.\\n      All alone,\\n  And who toiling, toiling, toiling,\\n    In that muffled monotone,\\n  Feel a glory in so rolling\\n    On the human heart a stone--\\n  They are neither man nor woman--\\n  They are neither brute nor human--\\n      They are Ghouls:\\n  And their king it is who tolls;\\n  And he rolls, rolls, rolls,\\n           Rolls\\n  A pæan from the bells!\\n  And his merry bosom swells\\n  With the pæan of the bells!\\n  And he dances, and he yells;\\n  Keeping time, time, time,\\n  In a sort of Runic rhyme,\\n  To the pæan of the bells--\\n      Of the bells:\\n  Keeping time, time, time,\\n  In a sort of Runic rhyme,\\n    To the throbbing of the bells--\\n  Of the bells, bells, bells--\\n    To the sobbing of the bells;\\n  Keeping time, time, time,\\n    As he knells, knells, knells,\\n  In a happy Runic rhyme,\\n  To the rolling of the bells--\\n  Of the bells, bells, bells--\\n  To the tolling of the bells,\\n  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,\\n    Bells, bells, bells--\\n  To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.\\n\\n\\n1849.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nULALUME.\\n\\n\\n  The skies they were ashen and sober;\\n    The leaves they were crisped and sere--\\n    The leaves they were withering and sere;\\n  It was night in the lonesome October\\n    Of my most immemorial year;\\n  It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\\n    In the misty mid region of Weir--\\n  It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\\n    In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\\n\\n  Here once, through an alley Titanic.\\n    Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--\\n    Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\\n  These were days when my heart was volcanic\\n    As the scoriac rivers that roll--\\n    As the lavas that restlessly roll\\n  Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek\\n    In the ultimate climes of the pole--\\n  That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\\n    In the realms of the boreal pole.\\n\\n  Our talk had been serious and sober,\\n    But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--\\n    Our memories were treacherous and sere--\\n  For we knew not the month was October,\\n  And we marked not the night of the year--\\n    (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)\\n  We noted not the dim lake of Auber--\\n    (Though once we had journeyed down here)--\\n  Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,\\n    Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\\n\\n  And now as the night was senescent\\n    And star-dials pointed to morn--\\n    As the sun-dials hinted of morn--\\n  At the end of our path a liquescent\\n    And nebulous lustre was born,\\n  Out of which a miraculous crescent\\n    Arose with a duplicate horn--\\n  Astarte\\'s bediamonded crescent\\n    Distinct with its duplicate horn.\\n\\n  And I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:\\n    She rolls through an ether of sighs--\\n    She revels in a region of sighs:\\n  She has seen that the tears are not dry on\\n    These cheeks, where the worm never dies,\\n  And has come past the stars of the Lion\\n    To point us the path to the skies--\\n    To the Lethean peace of the skies--\\n  Come up, in despite of the Lion,\\n    To shine on us with her bright eyes--\\n  Come up through the lair of the Lion,\\n    With love in her luminous eyes.\"\\n\\n  But Psyche, uplifting her finger,\\n    Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust--\\n    Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--\\n  Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!\\n    Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"\\n  In terror she spoke, letting sink her\\n    Wings till they trailed in the dust--\\n  In agony sobbed, letting sink her\\n    Plumes till they trailed in the dust--\\n    Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\\n\\n  I replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:\\n    Let us on by this tremulous light!\\n    Let us bathe in this crystalline light!\\n  Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming\\n    With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--\\n    See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!\\n  Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\\n    And be sure it will lead us aright--\\n  We safely may trust to a gleaming\\n    That cannot but guide us aright,\\n    Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"\\n\\n  Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\\n    And tempted her out of her gloom--\\n    And conquered her scruples and gloom;\\n  And we passed to the end of a vista,\\n    But were stopped by the door of a tomb--\\n    By the door of a legended tomb;\\n  And I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,\\n    On the door of this legended tomb?\"\\n    She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--\\n    \\'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"\\n\\n  Then my heart it grew ashen and sober\\n    As the leaves that were crisped and sere--\\n    As the leaves that were withering and sere;\\n  And I cried--\"It was surely October\\n    On _this_ very night of last year\\n    That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--\\n    That I brought a dread burden down here!\\n    On this night of all nights in the year,\\n    Ah, what demon has tempted me here?\\n  Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--\\n    This misty mid region of Weir--\\n  Well I know, now, this dank

must not say _how_ many--but _not_ many.\\n  It was a July midnight; and from out\\n  A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,\\n  Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,\\n  There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,\\n  With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,\\n  Upon the upturn\\'d faces of a thousand\\n  Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,\\n  Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--\\n  Fell on the upturn\\'d faces of these roses\\n  That gave out, in return for the love-light,\\n  Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--\\n  Fell on the upturn\\'d faces of these roses\\n  That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted\\n  By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.\\n\\n  Clad all in white, upon a violet bank\\n  I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon\\n  Fell on the upturn\\'d faces of the roses,\\n  And on thine own, upturn\\'d--alas, in sorrow!\\n\\n  Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--\\n  Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),\\n  That bade me pause before that garden-gate,\\n  To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?\\n  No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,\\n  Save only thee and me--(O Heaven!--O God!\\n  How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)--\\n  Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked--\\n  And in an instant all things disappeared.\\n  (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)\\n  The pearly lustre of the moon went out:\\n  The mossy banks and the meandering paths,\\n  The happy flowers and the repining trees,\\n  Were seen no more: the very roses\\' odors\\n  Died in the arms of the adoring airs.\\n  All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:\\n  Save only the divine light in thine eyes--\\n  Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.\\n  I saw but them--they were the world to me.\\n  I saw but them--saw only them for hours--\\n  Saw only them until the moon went down.\\n  What wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten\\n  Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!\\n  How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!\\n  How silently serene a sea of pride!\\n  How daring an ambition! yet how deep--\\n  How fathomless a capacity for love!\\n\\n  But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,\\n  Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;\\n  And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees\\n  Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained._\\n  They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone.\\n  Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,\\n  _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.\\n  They follow me--they lead me through the years.\\n\\n  They are my ministers--yet I their slave.\\n  Their office is to illumine and enkindle--\\n  My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,\\n  And purified in their electric fire,\\n  And sanctified in their elysian fire.\\n  They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),\\n  And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to\\n  In the sad, silent watches of my night;\\n  While even in the meridian glare of day\\n  I see them still--two sweetly scintillant\\n  Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!\\n\\n\\n1846.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nANNABEL LEE.\\n\\n\\n  It was many and many a year ago,\\n    In a kingdom by the sea,\\n  That a maiden there lived whom you may know\\n    By the name of ANNABEL LEE;\\n  And this maiden she lived with no other thought\\n    Than to love and be loved by me.\\n\\n  _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,\\n    In this kingdom by the sea:\\n  But we loved with a love that was more than love--\\n    I and my ANNABEL LEE;\\n  With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\\n    Coveted her and me.\\n\\n  And this was the reason that, long ago,\\n    In this kingdom by the sea,\\n  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\\n    My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\\n  So that her highborn kinsmen came\\n    And bore her away from me,\\n  To shut her up in a sepulchre\\n    In this kingdom by the sea.\\n\\n  The angels, not half so happy in heaven,\\n    Went envying her and me--\\n  Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,\\n    In this kingdom by the sea)\\n  That the wind came out of the cloud by night,\\n    Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.\\n\\n  But our love it was stronger by far than the love\\n    Of those who were older than we--\\n    Of many far wiser than we--\\n  And neither the angels in heaven above,\\n    Nor the demons down under the sea,\\n  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul\\n    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.\\n\\n  For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\\n    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\\n  And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes\\n    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\\n  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\\n  Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,\\n    In her sepulchre there by the sea--\\n    In her tomb by the side of the sea.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nA VALENTINE.\\n\\n\\n  For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,\\n    Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,\\n  Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies\\n    Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.\\n  Search narrowly the lines!--they hold a treasure\\n    Divine--a talisman--an amulet\\n  That must be worn _at heart_.

THE RAVEN\\n\\n\\n\"The Raven\" was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New\\nYork \\'Evening Mirror\\'--a paper its author was then assistant editor of.\\nIt was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written\\nby N. P. Willis:\\n\\n  \"We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second\\n  number of the \\'American Review\\', the following remarkable poem by\\n  Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of\\n  \\'fugitive poetry\\' ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in\\n  English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of\\n  versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and\\n  \\'pokerishness.\\' It is one of those \\'dainties bred in a book\\' which we\\n  feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.\"\\n\\nIn the February number of the \\'American Review\\' the poem was published\\nas by \"Quarles,\" and it was introduced by the following note, evidently\\nsuggested if not written by Poe himself.\\n\\n  [\"The following lines from a correspondent--besides the deep, quaint\\n  strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some\\n  ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless\\n  intended by the author--appears to us one of the most felicitous\\n  specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The\\n  resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and\\n  sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been\\n  thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the\\n  language. While the classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by\\n  power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own,\\n  chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and\\n  very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme.\\n  Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients\\n  had in common with us. It will be seen that much of the melody of \\'The\\n  Raven\\' arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds\\n  in unusual places. In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if\\n  all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed\\n  merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form: but the presence\\n  in all the others of one line--mostly the second in the verse\"\\n  (stanza?)--\"which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in\\n  the middle, like that before the short line in the Sapphio Adonic,\\n  while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with\\n  any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect.\\n  We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were\\n  better understood.\"\\n\\n  ED. \\'Am. Rev.\\']\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n2.   THE BELLS\\n\\n\\nThe bibliographical history of \"The Bells\" is curious. The subject, and\\nsome lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet\\'s\\nfriend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,\\nheaded it, \"The Bells. By Mrs. M. A. Shew.\" This draft, now the editor\\'s\\nproperty, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus:\\n\\n\\nI.\\n\\n      The bells!--ah the bells!\\n      The little silver bells!\\n  How fairy-like a melody there floats\\n          From their throats--\\n          From their merry little throats--\\n          From the silver, tinkling throats\\n    Of the bells, bells, bells--\\n            Of the bells!\\n\\nII.\\n\\n      The bells!--ah, the bells!\\n      The heavy iron bells!\\n  How horrible a monody there floats\\n          From their throats--\\n          From their deep-toned throats--\\n          From their melancholy throats\\n          How I shudder at the notes\\n    Of the bells, bells, bells--\\n            Of the bells!\\n\\n\\nIn the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it\\nto the editor of the \\'Union Magazine\\'. It was not published. So, in the\\nfollowing February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much\\nenlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without\\npublication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current\\nversion, was sent, and in the following October was published in the\\n\\'Union Magazine\\'.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n3.   ULALUME\\n\\n\\nThis poem was first published in Colton\\'s \\'American Review\\' for December\\n1847, as \"To----Ulalume: a Ballad.\" Being reprinted immediately in\\nthe \\'Home Journal\\', it was copied into various publications with the\\nname of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to him.\\nWhen first published, it contained the following additional stanza which\\nPoe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman wisely suppressed:\\n\\n\\n  Said we then--the two, then--\"Ah, can it\\n      Have been that the woodlandish ghouls--\\n      The pitiful, the merciful ghouls--\\n  To bar up our path and to ban it\\n      From the secret that lies in these wolds--\\n  Had drawn up the spectre of a planet\\n      From the limbo of lunary souls--\\n  This sinfully scintillant planet\\n      From the Hell of the planetary souls?\"\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n4.   TO HELEN\\n\\n\\n\"To Helen\" (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published Until November\\n1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the\\n\\'Union Magazine\\' and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or\\ndesire of Poe, of the line, \"Oh, God! oh, Heaven--how my heart beats in\\ncoupling those two words\".\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n5.   ANNABEL LEE\\n\\n\\n\"Annabel Lee\" was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression\\nof the poet\\'s undying love for his deceased bride although at least one\\nof his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a\\ncopy of the ballad to the \\'Union Magazine\\', in which publication it\\nappeared in January 1850, three months after the author\\'s death. Whilst\\nsuffering from \"hope deferred\" as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of\\n\"Annabel Lee\" to the editor of the \\'Southern Literary Messenger\\', who\\npublished it in the November number of his periodical, a month after\\nPoe\\'s death. In the meantime the poet\\'s own copy, left among his papers,\\npassed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he\\nquoted the poem in an obituary of Poe in the New York \\'Tribune\\', before\\nany one else had an opportunity of publishing it.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n6.

Such portions of \"Politian\" as are known to the public first saw the\\nlight of publicity in the \\'Southern Literary Messenger\\' for December\\n1835 and January 1836, being styled \"Scenes from Politian; an\\nunpublished drama.\" These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845\\ncollection of Poems by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft\\nsubsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not\\nconsidered just to the poet\\'s memory to publish it. The work is a hasty\\nand unrevised production of its author\\'s earlier days of literary labor;\\nand, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his\\nreputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the\\nfollowing fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The\\nDuke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of\\nCastiglione her betrothed.\\n\\n\\n_Duke_.           Why do you laugh?\\n\\n_Castiglione_.    Indeed.\\n                  I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not\\n                  On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?\\n                  Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.\\n                  Alessandra, you and I, you must remember!\\n                  We were walking in the garden.\\n\\n_Duke_.           Perfectly.\\n                  I do remember it--what of it--what then?\\n\\n_Cas_.            O nothing--nothing at all.\\n\\n_Duke_.           Nothing at all!\\n                  It is most singular that you should laugh\\n                  At nothing at all!\\n\\n_Cas_.            Most singular--singular!\\n\\n_Duke_.           Look yon, Castiglione, be so kind\\n                  As tell me, sir, at once what \\'tis you mean.\\n                  What are you talking of?\\n\\n_Cas_.            Was it not so?\\n                  We differed in opinion touching him.\\n\\n_Duke_.           Him!--Whom?\\n\\n_Cas_.            Why, sir, the Earl Politian.\\n\\n_Duke_.           The Earl of Leicester! Yes!--is it he you mean?\\n                  We differed, indeed. If I now recollect\\n                  The words you used were that the Earl you knew\\n                  Was neither learned nor mirthful.\\n\\n_Cas_.            Ha! ha!--now did I?\\n\\n_Duke_.           That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time\\n                  You were wrong, it being not the character\\n                  Of the Earl--whom all the world allows to be\\n                  A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,\\n                  Too positive again.\\n\\n_Cas_.            \\'Tis singular!\\n                  Most singular! I could not think it possible\\n                  So little time could so much alter one!\\n                  To say the truth about an hour ago,\\n                  As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,\\n                  All arm in arm, we met this very man\\n                  The Earl--he, with his friend Baldazzar,\\n                  Having just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! he _is_ altered!\\n                  Such an account he gave me of his journey!\\n                  \\'Twould have made you die with laughter--such tales he\\n                    told\\n                  Of his caprices and his merry freaks\\n                  Along the road--such oddity--such humor--\\n                  Such wit--such whim--such flashes of wild merriment\\n                  Set off too in such full relief by the grave\\n                  Demeanor of his friend--who, to speak the truth\\n                  Was gravity itself--\\n\\n_Duke_.           Did I not tell you?\\n\\n_Cas_.            You did--and yet \\'tis strange! but true, as strange,\\n                  How much I was mistaken! I always thought\\n                  The Earl a gloomy man.\\n\\n_Duke_.           So, so, you see!\\n                  Be not too positive. Whom have we here?\\n                  It cannot be the Earl?\\n\\n_Cas_.            The Earl! Oh no!\\n                  Tis not the Earl--but yet it is--and leaning\\n                  Upon his friend Baldazzar. Ah! welcome, sir!\\n                  (_Enter Politian and Baldazzar_.)\\n                  My lord, a second welcome let me give you\\n                  To Rome--his Grace the Duke of Broglio.\\n                  Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl\\n                  Of Leicester in Great Britain.\\n                  [_Politian bows haughtily_.]\\n                  That, his friend\\n                  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey.

On the \"Poems written in Youth\" little comment is needed. This\\nsection includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 (which\\nwas subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second\\npublished volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in\\ntheir revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources.\\n\\n\"Al Aaraaf\" first appeared, with the sonnet \"To Silence\" prefixed to it,\\nin 1829, and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for\\n1831, however, this poem, its author\\'s longest, was introduced by the\\nfollowing twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent\\ncollections:\\n\\n\\nAL AARAAF.\\n\\n\\n  Mysterious star!\\n  Thou wert my dream\\n  All a long summer night--\\n  Be now my theme!\\n  By this clear stream,\\n  Of thee will I write;\\n  Meantime from afar\\n  Bathe me in light!\\n\\n  Thy world has not the dross of ours,\\n  Yet all the beauty--all the flowers\\n  That list our love or deck our bowers\\n  In dreamy gardens, where do lie\\n  Dreamy maidens all the day;\\n  While the silver winds of Circassy\\n  On violet couches faint away.\\n  Little--oh! little dwells in thee\\n  Like unto what on earth we see:\\n  Beauty\\'s eye is here the bluest\\n  In the falsest and untruest--\\n  On the sweetest air doth float\\n  The most sad and solemn note--\\n  If with thee be broken hearts,\\n  Joy so peacefully departs,\\n  That its echo still doth dwell,\\n  Like the murmur in the shell.\\n  Thou! thy truest type of grief\\n  Is the gently falling leaf--\\n  Thou! thy framing is so holy\\n  Sorrow is not melancholy.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n31. The earliest version of \"Tamerlane\" was included in the suppressed\\nvolume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now\\npublished. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and\\nimprovements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the\\nlines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at\\nleast.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n32. \"To Helen\" first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also \"The\\nValley of Unrest\" (as \"The Valley Nis\"), \"Israfel,\" and one or two\\nothers of the youthful pieces.\\n\\nThe poem styled \"Romance\" constituted the Preface of the 1829 volume,\\nbut with the addition of the following lines:\\n\\n\\n  Succeeding years, too wild for song,\\n  Then rolled like tropic storms along,\\n  Where, though the garish lights that fly\\n  Dying along the troubled sky,\\n  Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,\\n  The blackness of the general Heaven,\\n  That very blackness yet doth fling\\n  Light on the lightning\\'s silver wing.\\n\\n  For being an idle boy lang syne,\\n  Who read Anacreon and drank wine,\\n  I early found Anacreon rhymes\\n  Were almost passionate sometimes--\\n  And by strange alchemy of brain\\n  His pleasures always turned to pain--\\n  His naïveté to wild desire--\\n  His wit to love--his wine to fire--\\n  And so, being young and dipt in folly,\\n  I fell in love with melancholy.\\n\\n  And used to throw my earthly rest\\n  And quiet all away in jest--\\n  I could not love except where Death\\n  Was mingling his with Beauty\\'s breath--\\n  Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,\\n  Were stalking between her and me.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n  But _now_ my soul hath too much room--\\n  Gone are the glory and the gloom--\\n  The black hath mellow\\'d into gray,\\n  And all the fires are fading away.\\n\\n  My draught of passion hath been deep--\\n  I revell\\'d, and I now would sleep--\\n  And after drunkenness of soul\\n  Succeeds the glories of the bowl--\\n  An idle longing night and day\\n  To dream my very life away.\\n\\n  But dreams--of those who dream as I,\\n  Aspiringly, are damned, and die:\\n  Yet should I swear I mean alone,\\n  By notes so very shrilly blown,\\n  To break upon Time\\'s monotone,\\n  While yet my vapid joy and grief\\n  Are tintless of the yellow leaf--\\n  Why not an imp the greybeard hath,\\n  Will shake his shadow in my path--\\n  And e\\'en the greybeard will o\\'erlook\\n  Connivingly my dreaming-book.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n                                 DOUBTFUL POEMS.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nALONE.\\n\\n\\n  From childhood\\'s hour I have not been\\n  As others were--I have not seen\\n  As others saw--I could not bring\\n  My passions from a common spring--\\n  From the same source I have not taken\\n  My sorrow--I could not awaken\\n  My heart to joy at the same tone--\\n  And all I loved--_I_ loved alone--\\n  _Thou_--in my childhood--in the dawn\\n  Of a most stormy life--was drawn\\n  From every depth of good and ill\\n  The mystery which binds me still--\\n  From the torrent, or the fountain--\\n  From the red cliff of the mountain--\\n  From the sun that round me roll\\'d\\n  In its autumn tint of gold--\\n  From the lightning in the sky\\n  As it passed me flying by--\\n  From the thunder and the storm--\\n  And the cloud that took the form\\n  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)\\n  Of a demon in my view.\\n\\n\\nMarch 17, 1829.\\n\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\nTO ISADORE.\\n\\n\\nI.
