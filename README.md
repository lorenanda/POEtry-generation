# Generating POEtry with Tensorflow

Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary how nice it would be to read *new* poems by one of my favorite poets, Edgar Allan Poe... I decided to use the power of neural networks to generate new poems, based on the style of Poe's original ones.

I used [my web-scraper]() to scrape poems from [here](https://poestories.com/poetry.php), which I then fed into a LSTM neural network. The model achieved ~80% accuracy and generated some more-or-less readable POEms, like:

  *ah night of all nights*

  *in the year and untruest above*

  *how song above my first door of it*

  *is it be the whispered word*
