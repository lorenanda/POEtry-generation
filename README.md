# Generating POEtry with Tensorflow

Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary how enriching it would be to read *new* poems by one of my favorite poets, Edgar Allan Poe, if only he was still alive... I stumbled across a youtube tutorial on how to generate Irish songs with Tensorflow.

### Files
- *Poe.txt* - text file with poems by E.A. Poe used for training the model
- *.ipynb* - Jupyter notebook with the code
